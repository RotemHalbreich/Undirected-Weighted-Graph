# *Assignment Ex1:*

## :computer: *Object Oriented Programming (Ariel University - Computer science department):*

### :bar_chart: *This project deals with the subject of "Graph Theory" focusing on undirected weighted graph.*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### :white_check_mark: *Initialize the project:*
*Clone the project using the Command Line by typing the command:*

`git clone https://github.com/RotemHalbreich/Ex1.git`

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 🔧 *The project assembeled of 3 different classes implemented from 3 different interfaces:*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## :large_blue_diamond: *NodeInfo:*
*An inner private class representing the graph's vertices:*
	
Including methods:
- `getKey()` - Get a unique key ID for each vertex.
- `getInfo()` - Get the info of a vertex as a String, marking whether the vertex was "VISITED" or "UNVISITED".
- `getTag()` - Get the tag of a vertex marking the weight count of the previous vertices to the current vertex included.
- `setTag()` - Set the tag of a vertex.
- `compareTo()` - A function for tags comparison (weight).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## :large_blue_diamond: *WGraph_DS:*
*Represents a graph assembeled of vertices:
In this class I chose using the HashMap data structure for its fast running time O(1).
My implementation is based on HashMap of vertices linked with a unique key for each vertex,
and HashMap of edges which links a vertex by a unique key to another vertex including
the weight of the edge between them, using HashMap inside HashMap.*
	
Including methods:
- `getNode()` - Get a vertex by a unique key.
- `hasEdge()` - Check if there's an edge between two vertices.
- `getEdge()` - Gets an edge between two vertices represented by weight.
- `addNode()` - Adds a vertex to the graph.
- `connect()` - Connect between two vertices.
- `getV()` - Get the neighbors of the vertex as a collection.
- `getV(node_id)` - Get the value of the graph's vertices as a collection.
- `removeNode()` - Removes a vertex from the graph.
- `removeEdge()` - Removes an edge from the graph.
- `nodeSize()` - returns the number of vetices in the graph.
- `edgeSize()` - returns the number of edges in the graph.
- `getMC()` - returns the number of changes made to the graph.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## :large_blue_diamond: *WGraph_Algo:* 
*Represents the algorithms we apply on the graph. 
In this class I use Dijkstra & BFS algorithms for implementing the algorithms below:*
	
- `init()` - Initializes the graph.
- `getGraph()` - Returns an undirectional weighted graph.
- `copy()` - Computes a deep copy of the graph.
- `isConnected()` - Checks if all the vertices of the graph are connected by edges.
- `shortestPathDist()` - Returns the shortest path distance between two vertices of the graph (minimum weight). 
- `shortestPath()` - Returns the shortest path route between two vertices of the graph (minimum weight).
- `save()` - Saves a graph to a file.
- `load()` - Loads a graph from a file.
